# Open Web VueJS

Open Web is a project that currently aims to be an AI-powered center for crypto knowledge. Beyond that it is meant to expand in an open-source manner to become both a Web2 UX layer for Web3, and eventually build out an _Open Web_.

## Setup
```
npm install
```

## Running Locally, Builds, Etc
Start Vue CLI UI to serve, build, etc
```
vue ui
```

## Deployment
After building using Vue CLI, simply host the contents of the /dist folder and point the URL at index.html. For routing needs in the future, we'll probably use VueRouter and still deploy it exactly like this.

## State Management
This app currently has no state management, but we'll probably use Vuex or another state management library soon.


## API
This browser client uses an AI-powered API [Insert Github Link Here]. Shout-out to my man Squids.

## Dev Stack
This client is a Vue3 project using SCSS and JS. In the future it may additionally use TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, VueRouter, Vuex, Etc.
